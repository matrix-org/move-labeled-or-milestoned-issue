# Move labeled or milestoned issue

### Demo
This demo shows an issue that has the priority label added automatically get moved from column `New issues should show up here` to `Priority labeled stuff should automatically move here`.

### Use Case
Everytime a specific label is added to an issue (or issue added to a milestone), the associated card in a project should be moved to a specific column. For example, you want any issue that gets labeled with "priority" to automatically move to the column that corresponds to "on deck". If the issue is not on the project board, it will be created in the desired column. If it has already been added, it will be moved to the correct column.

This action can be used for projects that are linked and setup at the org level or repository level. The token that is supplied though must have `repo` permissions. If the project is linked at the org level, it must also have `org:read` permissions.

### Input

| Input | Description  |
|---------|---|
|  action-token | An access token that will be used to move or create an issue in a desired column. The standard token that is present for each action will not be sufficient as it does not have sufficient privilages. You must create one that has `repo` permissions (see below)  |
| project-url  | The url of the project. Will be something like `https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/1` or `https://github.com/konradpabjan/example/projects/1`  |
| column-name | The name of the column in project that issues should be moved to |
| label-name | The label that should trigger an issue to be moved to a specific column (mutually exclusive with milestone-name) |
| milestone-name | The milestone that should trigger an issue to be moved to a specific column (mutually exclusive with label-name) |
| columns-to-ignore | Comma separated list of column names that should be ignored. If an issue/card already exists in a column with one of the names, it will be ignored. Use `*` to ignore all columns. This is optional|
| archive-behaviour | One of `error`, `ignore`, or `restore` to determine what happens to archived cards: an error (default), nothing, or un-archiving. This is optional. |


### Creating an action-token

- Create a new personal access token with the appropriate permissions at https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Add the personal access token to your repository secrets: https://github.com/organization_name/repository_name/settings/secrets (for an organization), https://github.com/repository_owner/repository_name/settings/secrets (for a standard repository), and remember the name
- Use the newly saved token in your YAML file as input for `action-token`. In the example below, it is called `MY_TOKEN`


### Example YAML (label)

This YAML is meant to be triggered whenever an issue has been labled.

```
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]
jobs:
  Move_Labeled_Issue_On_Project_Board:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: konradpabjan/move-labeled-or-milestoned-issue@v2.0
      with:
        action-token: "${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}"
        project-url: "https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/1"
        column-name: "On Deck"
        label-name: "priority"
        columns-to-ignore: "In Review,Ready to deploy,Done"
 ```

### Example YAML (milestone)

This YAML is meant to be triggered whenever an issue has been milestoned.

```
on:
  issues:
    types: [milestoned]
jobs:
  Move_Milestoned_Issue_On_Project_Board:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: konradpabjan/move-labeled-or-milestoned-issue@v2.0
      with:
        action-token: "${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}"
        project-url: "https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/1"
        column-name: "On Deck"
        milestone-name: "v1.0"
        columns-to-ignore: "In Review,Ready to deploy,Done"
 ```
